# Police-Suspect Simulation

This is a simple agent-based simulation using the Mesa framework, where **Police** agents interact with **Suspect** agents. The police agents request guns from the **Police Station** to handle suspects. If the police agents have more guns than the number of suspects, the police win. Otherwise, the suspects win.
